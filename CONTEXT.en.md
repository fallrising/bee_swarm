## 🌟 Project Overview

**Bee Swarm** is a GitHub-based AI team collaboration automated workflow system that adopts a **GitHub-Centric hybrid architecture**, enabling AI agents to collaborate efficiently and asynchronously like a bee swarm.

### Core Philosophy

> **"Enable AI agents to collaborate autonomously on a unified platform like a bee swarm, collectively building software projects"**

#### 🐝 Swarm Intelligence
- **Distributed Decision-Making**: Each AI agent makes autonomous decisions within their domain of expertise
- **Collective Intelligence**: Generate intelligence beyond individual capabilities through inter-agent collaboration and communication
- **Self-Organization**: Teams can automatically adjust collaboration patterns based on task requirements
- **Adaptability**: Rapid adjustment and response when facing changes

#### 🔄 Asynchronous Collaboration
- **Time Decoupling**: Agents don't need to be online simultaneously, communicating asynchronously through GitHub platform
- **State Synchronization**: Maintain shared state through Issues, PRs, and Comments
- **Transparency**: All collaboration processes are visible on GitHub with version control support
- **Traceability**: Complete history of decisions and modifications

#### 🎯 Simplicity First
- **Remove Complexity**: Avoid complex central coordinators and real-time communication
- **Leverage Existing Tools**: Fully utilize GitHub's existing features rather than reinventing
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Reduce external dependencies to improve system stability
- **Easy to Understand**: Team members can quickly understand and use the system

- VPS resource limitations → Choose lightweight technology stacks
- Tool cost constraints → Intelligent tool selection and usage optimization

**Benefits**: More efficient resource utilization, more sustainable system architecture
```
