## 🤝 Collaboration Pattern Design

### Collaboration Design Principles

1. **Role Specialization and Division**
   - Product Manager: Requirements analysis, priority decisions, project coordination
   - Backend Developer: API design, data processing, performance optimization
   - Frontend Developer: User interface, interaction design, user experience
   - DevOps Engineer: Deployment automation, monitoring operations, infrastructure

2. **Asynchronous Collaboration Priority**
   - Asynchronous communication based on GitHub Issues/PR
   - Avoid real-time meeting dependencies
   - Support different time zones and work rhythms

3. **Transparency and Traceability**
   - All decisions are documented
   - Complete and queryable change history
   - Clear responsibility attribution

### Role Relationship Matrix

| Role | Product Manager | Backend Developer | Frontend Developer | DevOps Engineer |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Product Manager** | - | Requirements transmission | Requirements transmission | Deployment coordination |
| **Backend Developer** | Technical assessment | - | API coordination | Deployment configuration |
| **Frontend Developer** | UI feedback | API integration | - | Build configuration |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Operations reports | Environment support | Environment support | - |
