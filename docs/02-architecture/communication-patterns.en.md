## ðŸ”„ Asynchronous Coordination Patterns

### Coordination Mechanism Design

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Asynchronous Coordination Layer"
        A[Task Distribution Mechanism]
        B[State Synchronization Mechanism]
        C[Dependency Management Mechanism]
        D[Conflict Resolution Mechanism]
    end
    
    subgraph "Communication Interface"
        E[GitHub API]
        F[Webhook Events]
        G[Action Triggers]
    end
    
    subgraph "Role Processing Layer"
        H[Task Reception]
        I[Status Updates]
        J[Result Notification]
        K[Error Handling]
    end
    
    A --> E
    B --> F
    C --> G
    D --> E
    
    E --> H
    F --> I
    G --> J
    E --> K
```

### Message Flow Protocol

**1. Task Distribution Process**
```
Creation Phase:
1. PM creates Issue (task description)
2. System automatically tags relevant roles
3. Roles receive task notifications
4. Roles confirm task reception

Processing Phase:
1. Role updates Issue status
2. Role adds processing progress comments
3. System synchronizes status changes
4. Related roles receive status notifications

Completion Phase:
1. Role submits PR (result delivery)
2. Other roles perform code review
3. PM provides final confirmation
4. System closes related Issue
```

**2. State Synchronization Protocol**
```yaml
# State synchronization specifications
task_status:
  pending: "Pending"
  in_progress: "In Progress"
  review: "Under Review"
  testing: "Testing"
  completed: "Completed"
  blocked: "Blocked"

role_status:
  active: "Active"
  busy: "Busy"
  idle: "Idle"
  offline: "Offline"

project_status:
  planning: "Planning"
  development: "Development"
  testing: "Testing"
  deployment: "Deployment"
  completed: "Completed"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Task Management Protocol

### Task Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: PM creates task
    Created --> Assigned: Assign role
    Assigned --> InProgress: Start processing
    InProgress --> Review: Submit for review
    Review --> Testing: Review passed
    Review --> InProgress: Needs modification
    Testing --> Completed: Tests passed
    Testing --> InProgress: Tests failed
    InProgress --> Blocked: Encountered blocking issue
    Blocked --> InProgress: Blocking resolved
    Completed --> [*]: Task completed
```

### Dependency Management Mechanism

**Dependency Types**
```
Sequential Dependency:
â”œâ”€â”€ Backend API completed â†’ Frontend integration begins
â”œâ”€â”€ Database design completed â†’ Backend development begins
â””â”€â”€ Infrastructure ready â†’ Application deployment begins

Parallel Dependency:
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend and backend can develop in parallel
â”œâ”€â”€ Documentation writing parallel with development
â””â”€â”€ Test environment parallel with development environment preparation

Conditional Dependency:
â”œâ”€â”€ Performance tests passed â†’ Deployment allowed
â”œâ”€â”€ Security review passed â†’ Release allowed
â””â”€â”€ User acceptance passed â†’ Task closure allowed
```

## ðŸš¨ Conflict Resolution Mechanism

### Conflict Types and Handling

**1. Resource Conflicts**
```
Scenario: Multiple roles simultaneously modifying the same file
Handling:
1. GitHub automatically detects conflicts
2. Later committer responsible for resolving conflicts
3. Invite related roles for negotiation
4. PM makes final decision (if needed)
```

**2. Priority Conflicts**
```
Scenario: Task priority disagreements
Handling:
1. PM has final decision authority
2. Consider business value and technical dependencies
3. Record decision rationale and basis
4. Notify all related roles
```

**3. Technical Solution Conflicts**
```
Scenario: Disagreements on technical implementation approaches
Handling:
1. Technical roles propose different solutions
2. Conduct technical discussion in Issues
3. Consider maintainability, performance, cost
4. PM coordinates and makes final decision
```

## ðŸ“Š Status Monitoring and Feedback

### Monitoring Metrics

**Efficiency Metrics**
```yaml
task_metrics:
  average_completion_time: "Average completion time"
  task_throughput: "Task throughput"
  blocking_frequency: "Blocking occurrence frequency"
  role_utilization: "Role utilization rate"

quality_metrics:
  code_review_cycles: "Code review cycles"
  bug_detection_rate: "Bug detection rate"
  test_coverage: "Test coverage"
  documentation_completeness: "Documentation completeness"

collaboration_metrics:
  communication_frequency: "Communication frequency"
  response_time: "Response time"
  decision_speed: "Decision speed"
  conflict_resolution_time: "Conflict resolution time"
```

### Feedback Mechanism

**Automated Feedback**
```
GitHub Actions Triggers:
â”œâ”€â”€ Code commit â†’ Automated testing â†’ Result notification
â”œâ”€â”€ PR creation â†’ Code analysis â†’ Quality report
â”œâ”€â”€ Issue status change â†’ Progress update â†’ Related notifications
â””â”€â”€ Deployment complete â†’ Monitoring check â†’ Health report
```

**Manual Feedback**
```
Regular Assessment:
â”œâ”€â”€ Daily progress updates (Issue Comments)
â”œâ”€â”€ Weekly summary reports (Project Dashboard)
â”œâ”€â”€ Milestone reviews (Milestone Review)
â””â”€â”€ Project retrospectives (Project Retrospective)
```
