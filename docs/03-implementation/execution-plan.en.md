# ðŸš€ **Bee Swarm Execution Plan**

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**

This execution plan adopts a **step-by-step implementation** strategy, starting from a single role and gradually building a complete AI development team system. Each stage has clear objectives and verifiable outcomes.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Execution Strategy**

### Core Philosophy
1. **Single Role Priority**: First make one role fully functional, then expand to other roles
2. **Complete Functionality**: Each role must be able to independently complete tasks within its responsibility scope
3. **Collaboration Verification**: Verify inter-role collaboration mechanisms through small projects
4. **Iterative Optimization**: Continuously optimize and improve based on actual usage

### Technical Foundation
- **Based on VNC Lab**: Use [VNC Lab](https://github.com/fallrising/vnc_lab) project as container foundation
- **AI Tool Rotation**: Each role can rotate between different AI programming assistants
- **GitHub-Driven**: All collaboration through GitHub features
- **Single VPS Single Role**: Ensure resource isolation and stability
