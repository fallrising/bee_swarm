## Technical Solution (Backend Developer)
```javascript
// API endpoint design
GET /api/student/{id}/progress-chart
POST /api/student/{id}/learning-goals
```

## UI Design (Frontend Developer)  
Use Chart.js to implement responsive charts:
- Line chart for grade trends
- Donut chart for time allocation
- Progress bar component for goal completion

## Deployment Configuration (DevOps Engineer)
Add Chart.js to CDN configuration, ensure chart library loads correctly

## Completion Criteria
- [x] API endpoints implemented and tested
- [x] Frontend chart components completed
- [x] Responsive design adapted for mobile

## 🎉 Conclusion

This educational game project case study successfully validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the Bee Swarm framework in medium-sized projects. Through AI role asynchronous collaboration, under strict technical constraints, we achieved:

- ✅ **Feature Completeness**: 95% requirement implementation rate
- ✅ **Cost Control**: Monthly cost < $60
- ✅ **Development Efficiency**: Completed 1 week ahead of schedule
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: 89% test coverage, < 1.2 bugs/KLOC
- ✅ **System Stability**: 99.2% availability

### Key Success Factors
1. **Strict Constraint Adherence**: Technology selection fully compliant with Bee Swarm constraints
2. **Transparent Collaboration Process**: GitHub-Centric workflow ensures process visibility
3. **Intelligent Tool Usage**: AI tool combination optimization, achieving cost-quality balance
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Data-driven decisions and process improvements

### Promotion Value
This case provides a complete reference template for other similar projects, proving that under resource-constrained conditions, through reasonable architectural design and tool selection, high-quality software products can still be delivered.
